# printftester
Peers mega colourful tester for printf

### Ultimate.c tests for undefined behaviour also, because I wanted to handle it. Use at your own risk.
### Everything in regular.c IS defined behaviour

## Usage:
# Clone this repo inside your own ft_printf repository
# (if neccessary) replace the first line of the regular.c/ultimate.c file to match your headerfile
# run make in this directory
